# WebServiceMovieDownload

A simple mobile application for iOS and Android that hits a web service and downloads movies to display in a list along with their associated image if available. Clicking on a movie should navigate the user to a screen that displays additional details about the movie. The user should have the ability to add and remove movies from their “Favorites”. The user should be able to view their favorites. Favorite movies should persist between sessions. 

Favorites will be saved on the detail screen. Future loads of the detail screen should show either “Save to Favorites” if it’s not in their favorites or “Remove from Favorites” if it’s in their favorites.
